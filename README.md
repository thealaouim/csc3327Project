	Gym Booking System

## Overview

The application is a Gym booking system that has three types of accounts, an admin, a service desk account and a client account. The client will be able to book the different facilities that the Gym has within the maximum limits of the persons allowed. This application will allow the Gym to automate the booking process and organize the clients of the gym as well as collect data about the different clients in order to increase its customer satisfaction. This platform is needed due to the current coronavirus crisis in order to enable the gym facilities to conform to the pandemic safety guidelines by the World Health Organization.
The clients will be able to book sessions that are 1 hour long, and they can book the sessions no earlier than 24 hours before the session time. Each service desk account will be connected to one facility or more. And will be able to see the booked sessions by facility and the individuals who have the sessions by name and other information. On the other hand a client will be able to book a facility for a maximum of 3 sessions per week.

## Technologies 
  
For the implementation of the software, we will use the following technologies:
- Bootstrap: We will use Bootstrap library for css components for its ease of use and adopt simple user interface designs
- React: React will be used as a front-end framework in order to avoid repetitive code by using its components that are reusable and contained. 
- Redux: We will use redux for its redux store functionality such that all of the data of the application will be stored in one place
- NodeJs: We will use NodeJs for the backend in order to use javascript for the whole project. The runtime environment will allow the handling of http requests and responses
- Express: the framework will simplify the handling of the requests and responses and help create a restful api
- JWT: JSON Web Token will be used for authentication of the users along with Bcrypt
- Sequelize: will be used as ORM to abstract the queries to the Postgres database server
- Postgres: We will use it for the storage of data as a relational database
